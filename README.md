# Rectangle Packing

Repository for Lukas' and my solution to the practical programming course on the rectangle packing problem in the summer term 2018. We should implement the sequence pair algorithm to find area- and bounding box optimal rectangle packings. We succeeded mainly, but missread the assignment a bit. We still received a grade of "good".
